                <p class="text-faded">Hi, I am Dr. Mayra Rodr√≠guez and I am an urban and community forestry educator. This means that I am part of the Cooperative Extension System, a nationwide education system that translates science into action by empowering communities to meet the challenges they face and protect the environment.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">Specifically, I examine interactions between nature and people to identify the factors that stop us from reaching equitable resilience. I use this knowledge to support institutions, governmental agencies, community group, etc. addressing environmental and climate injustices via management of the urban forest. I also plan, coordinate and hold educational campaigns for public engagement in urban forestry and conservation.</p>
