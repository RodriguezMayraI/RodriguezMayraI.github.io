                <p class="text-faded">Hi, I am Dr. Mayra Rodr√≠guez. I am an urban and community forestry extension educator. This means that I am part of the United States Cooperative Extension System, a nationwide education system that translates science into action by empowering communities to meet the challenges they face and protect the environment.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">This is my personal website, which lists all of my peer-reviewed scientific journal articles. My research has examined the interactions between nature and people to identify the factors that stop us from achieving equitable resilience. I've used this knowledge to support institutions, governmental agencies, and community groups addressing environmental and climate injustice via management of the urban forest. I've also used it to plan, coordinate and hold educational campaigns for public engagement in urban forestry and conservation.</p>
