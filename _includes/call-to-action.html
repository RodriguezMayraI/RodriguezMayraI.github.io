                <p class="text-faded">I use remote sensing to map natural resources and study their distribution across urban-rural gradients, identifying provisioning and accessibility patterns. I am experienced in spatial mapping, ecological modeling and social surveying. I am also a promoter of community engagement in scientific research and sustainability through workshops, seminars, and data collection that incentivize the conservation of greenspaces and the management of resource provisioning. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Gund Institute for the Environment and the Spatial Analysis Lab (SAL) at the University of Vermont.</p>
