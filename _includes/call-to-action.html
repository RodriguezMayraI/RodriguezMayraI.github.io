                <p class="text-faded">Hi, I’m Dr. Mayra I. Rodríguez, an Extension Educator in Urban and Community Forestry. My work centers on community-engaged research and education at the intersection of urban forestry, environmental justice, and spatial data. As part of the United States Cooperative Extension System, I translate science into action by working alongside communities to address environmental challenges and advance equitable, place-based solutions.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">Through participatory methods, geospatial analysis and applied education, I bridge research, policy and community priorities to advance socio-ecological resilience knowledge. I use this knowledge to support institutions, governmental agencies and community organizations addressing environmental and climate injustice through urban forest management, and to design and deliver educational programs that foster public engagement in urban forestry and conservation.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">This personal website offers a snapshot of my work. Read my vita, or scroll down for my portfolio.</p>
