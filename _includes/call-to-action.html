                <p class="text-faded">I use remote sensing to map natural resources and study their distribution from an equitable development and environmental justice perspective. I specialize in spatial mapping, ecological modeling and social surveying. I am a promoter of community engagement in scientific research, and an advocate for open data.
                    
                    Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Gund Institute for the Environment with the Spatial Analysis Laboratory (SAL) at the University of Vermont (UVM).
