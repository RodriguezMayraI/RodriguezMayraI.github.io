                <p class="text-faded">I use remote sensing to map natural resources and study their distribution across urban-rural gradients, identifying provisioning and accessibility patterns. I am also a promoter of community engagement in scientific research and sustainability through workshops, seminars, and data collection that incentivize the conservation of greenspaces and the management of resource provisioning. I received a $15,000 grant from the Indiana Water Resources Research Center to assess the contributions of urban greenspaces to human health through water quantity and quality, and their accessibility to Midwestern communities. I co-led a National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center project, where planners, biologists and sociologists came together to assess the role of urban food systems in Latin America. I also collaborated with Puerto Rican low-income communities in pro-conservation management of an urban wetland. I am experienced in R programming, natural resources modeling, natural resources valuation, and historical and scenario-based mapping.</p>
